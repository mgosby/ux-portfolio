    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>Hey, I'm Mercedes Gosby.</h3>
    <p>I'm a User Experience Designer and Researcher</p>
    <p>I graduated from the School of Information and Library Science at UNC with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. I also double majored in psychology. After taking INLS 490: User Experience Design, I decided to pursue a career in UX Design and usability. I am drawn to the way people think and feel when interacting with computers.
  
    <p>As a student, I was fortunate to work with a usability specialist on the improvement of the UNC Libraries Web site. We used paper prototypes to test the visibility of a book search feature. After graduation, I worked with the Go NAP SACC team on the designs of their interactive training modules. I introduced the team to card sorting and usability testing and helped them create a roadmap for their Web site design and development process.</p>
  
    <p>What do I like to do? Eat. Cook. Eat the food that I cook... I really enjoy reading, and you can usually find me in a library or taking pictures of books in the book store that I will check out from the library!</p>
